 Short description:
 ==================

 GPSR (Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing) is a geographic routing protocol proposed for wireless ad hoc 
 and sensor networks [1] that can be used to route data packets between any pair of nodes (i.e., it supports node-to- 
 node communication). GPSR assumes that every sensor node is aware of its own location and the locations of 
 its neighbors. In GPSR, nodes construct a planar subgraph based on the network topology in a distributive manner. This 
 distributive planarization algorithm is GG (Gabriel Graph) in this current implementation. 
 Forwarding a packet, each node first tries to greedily select the next-hop towards the base station 
 who is closest to the destination among all neighbors. If all neighbors are farther away from the destination 
 then the forwarding node (i.e., there is a local minimum), then the forwarding node falls back to perimeter mode 
 by using the planar subgraph to circumvent the local minimum. 

 Dependency:
 ===========
 
 This module depends on module Identity.
 A simple neigbor discovery protocol is implemented in module NeighborManagement (in order to 
 retrieve the coordinates of neighboring nodes).
 GPSR can be used through interface GPSR.nc, functions are documented there.
